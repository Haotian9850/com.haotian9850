<h4>About Me</h4>
<br/>
I am a driven 21-year-old student at the <i>University of Virginia</i> located in Charlottesville, Central Virginia majoring in BS computer science and BA astronomy. This is my resume and blog site!
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Computer science (BS) background: </b>in the past few years, I have spent most of my summers doing software engineering internships at a variety of places (from 10-people fintech startups to 5,000 people cybersecurity giant, both on-site and remote, but mostly around the Bay Area). From my past working experiences, I developed a solid interest in a variety of areas including high-performance distributed (cloud) computing, large-scale high-availability infrastructure automation (DevOps) and microservice-based full-stack web development. Having working experiences in both small and large dev teams also gave me the ability to quickly adapt to the team's software development method. Recently, I have also started a research project on deploying high-performance <i>Hadoop</i> cluster in Intel's <i>very fast, but also very persistent</i> Optane SSD. A copy of my resume as an aspiring software engineer is available upon <a style="color:blue" href="mailto:hl7gr@virginia.ed">request</a>.

<b>Astronomy (BA) background: </b>Ever since I was little, I have always been fascinated by the idea of <i>worlds beyond our own</i>. As an astronomy major, I work as a student research assistant for the <i>National Radio Astronomy Observatory</i> located in Charlottesville, Virginia on a project that aims to identify molecular lines from a particular type of object in our universe called <i>hot corinos</i> (yound star-forming cores sometimes with bidirectional molecular outflows). Expect a post on this soon!
