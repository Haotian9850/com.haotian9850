  "<p>
	Mt. Hamilton has long been hailed as one of the most exciting cycling climbs in North America. The 34 km (21.1 mile) stretchy but mild climb (average of ~6%) is classified, by the Tour de France standards, a Cat 2 climb and its peak, the Lick Observatory, the highest one overlooking Silicone Valley. Seizing the opportunity of interning in Silicone Valley during summer 2018, I decided to document every effort of mine trying to go up this hill here, while still being a somewhat stuck-in-place Collegiate Cat C hoping to be upgraded some time in the future. Read it at your own stake as this is going to be long and tedious - boringness alert!

	The day started in a somewhat non-San Jose fashion â€“ cloudy and no winds. By the time I rushed 20 k (12.4 mile) from my bunk bed stay, I was barely sweating â€“ until I found out that an accidental tip-over of my newly arrived CAAD 12 while being reassembled actually bent my rear derailleur hanger, leaving me only two gear to use: 52-11 and 34-28! Lacking any big ring up-hill capability, I reserved to use the later ratio all the way up. I canâ€™t blame my slow pace on this, however, since it already felt somewhat demanding to pedal up with a 34-28. In the first 5 miles I was able to catch up with some high-pace guys and drop some really-low-pace dudes, but as the altitude rise above 4,000 ft, oxygen started became a problem for a heavy-breathing cyclist (and I doubt a normal, healthy adult at this altitude and at rest would be affected anyway). Heartbeat accelerated. Muscles torn. The last 6 miles were definitely the hardest part of the entire climb (and therefore slowest). Itâ€™s a shame that I removed my unstable-but-somewhat-useful Stages from my bike a while ago for some quick money, but the effect is readily visible on my HR anyway. When I saw the great white dome of lick observatory through the heavy mist, I knew my time was gonna end up looking terribly â€“ and thatâ€™s why I am not posting it here. If you really wanna see how slow I was, follow me on Strava ;).

	Another Saturday. Another try. First mistake â€“ set an alarm at 6:30 am the night before but fell back to sleep immediately after muting the alarm. Eventually started the ride around 9:30 am. As a result, by the time I got on Mt. Hamilton road, I was heavily sweating with a ridiculously high average HR thanks to the constantly rising ambient temperature reaching a record 36 C (98.8 F). Also, most of the uphill Mt. Hamilton road are not covered in any tree shadow â€“ something so easily ignored from last trip significantly worsened the situation and almost made me quit halfway. However, I was able to hop on the wheels of some fast riders (someone with the tough mindset of climbing Mt. Hamilton around noon? Haha) and got (almost) free drafting for a considerable uphill time. Interestingly, I suffered less from oxygen deficiency this time and the entire uphill journey felt just a lot shorter.

					Perfect day for climbing! Left super early to avoid sun burn, only to find out it was a relatively heavily cloudy day. Light drizzling started the moment I got to the foot of Mt. Hamilton and lasted for the first 1/3 of my climb. Despite fear of bunking, I paced myself fairly high for the first half of todayâ€™s effort, reaching a 20 kph (12.4 mph) for the first hour-spirit were so high. However, the legs quickly turned sour and painful once I finished the second intermediate descent (around 20 kilometer (mile 12.4)). After some fighting against oxygen-deficient dizziness, I finally touched the white dome of Lick Observatory at 1:40. Not super impressive, but it was indeed an observable improvement from last time (1:57)- an improvement that I think was mainly due to todayâ€™s proper temperature. Next weekendâ€™s goal is set to 1:35.

					I will admit, I thought today\'s climb would see a significant gain in speed over last time\'s-perfect temperature, sufficient sleep (> 8 hours) and a concise but delicious continental breakfast-legs have never felt so fresh since Jeff Cup. However, unexpected wind situation messed up my plan a little bit: headwinds were much stronger than expected, and as a result, most of my trip from my temporary stay to Mt. Hamilton road became a sour battle against headwind-from *every* direction (literally). As planned, I paced the first half of the climb pretty high, eventually getting an average speed of 19.7 kph (12.2 mph) for the first 20 k (12.4 mi). To my surprise, despite the constant headwinds, it actually felt easier than last time going uphill on the last one third of the climb and I was able to sustain short standing-up power-bursts, a possible indication of me getting fitter (hopefully)? Eventually, I gained a one-minute improvement over last time-truly marginal for a 34 k (21.1 mi) climb and wasn\'t as good as I envisioned the day before, but hey that\'s still an improvement. Again, next weekend\'s goal == 1:35!

					Again, I overestimated my legs-although today\'s winds are minimal, temperature friendly, road surface in great condition, I still couldn\'t get myself into the 1:40 territory. As usual, I paced the first 20 k (12.4 mi) fairly high-even faster than last time, finishing the first 20 k in 57 minutes. However, my heart rate wasn\'t nearly as impressive-going to bed on 3 am Friday morning due to a OS crash definitively contributed to the abnormally high HR record I got today: for a steady 17 kph (10.6 mph) on a 7% gradient (sorry no power data-power meter is gone) on today\'s ride, I would have to reach somewhere between 178 and 182 BPM, ~10 BPM higher than usual. This severely limited my ability to high pace the last 10 k (6.2 mi) of today\'s effort, eventually resulting in a less-than-expected 1:42 uphill time-a 2-minute improvement. Just to put that into context, some Cat 1 guy I met from San Jose Cycling Club finished 1:25 today!

					Today\'s uphill effort really taught me how important pacing is for long climbs like this. Instead of going too hard and elevate my HR to a non-recoverable number, I chose to do a moderate start and hold my HR 10 ~ 15 BPM (still zone 4) under my climbing threshold. It worked. Today, I finished the second intermediate descent in 56 minutes, and finshed the entire climb in 1:38 - a 4-minute improvement over the last time, and finally made it into the 1:40 territory. I even found myself sprinting in the last 200 m or so. Finger crossed for getting into 1:35 next time. Also, why is there a supercar party on the top of Mt.Hamilton at 8 am?

          For most part of today\'s climb, I was pretty optimistic about surpassing last week (actually the week before last week)\'s time; however, Mt. Hamilton proved me wrong again. Although I was able to put myself at the beginning of the third intermediate climb 54 minutes after segment start, my legs fell short on the steeper sections and I eventually finished with the EXACT same time, 1:38 again, despite being almost 2 minute faster for the first two thrids of the climb. The disappointing lack of improvment can be attributed to my laziness last week-trading quality trainings for thicc salvadorian burritos, lol. Anyway, my summer time in San Jose is approaching an end and I was more than happy to have such oppotunity to climb up Mt. Hamilton so many times-not at a particular fast pace, though. Road riding in California felt so different from riding in Virginia-the heat, the sunshine (or, sunburn?) and the early morning mist-everything will certainly be worth remebering.

  " <p>
                So collegiate race season has just kicked off today in York River Park, Virginia. The collegiate Cat C race (which I was in) was set on a 42-mile course which repeats a 10-mile circuit four times. The circuit, located just outside of York River park has multiple mild ascends (not really â€œclimbsâ€) but is generally very flat and fast-it also has an uphill finish same as last year. Since this was my first Collegiate Cat C race, my goals were simple and clear: donâ€™t get dropped, and donâ€™t crash!
              </p>
                  <img class=image src=../resources/img/race_start.jpg>
              <p>
                The race started with immediate attacks after the 2-mile neutral roll out. The peloton managed to stay together for the first couple rounds of people trying to sprint away from it thanks to frequent counter attack. During the first 10 miles, I consciously moved up and got the chance to lead the race for maybe 2~3 times, while trying to counterattack every attempted break away (almost entirely consisted of Maryland riders!). Until the 10 mile mark, the race pace was highly manipulated and controlled by the peloton front (probably 6~7 riders) and all break away attempts obliterated. However, the peloton eased up almost immediately after entering the second lap due to the overwhelming first lap (averaged around 24 mph I believe). A group of 7~8 riders-a couple Maryland kids, Liberty, William and Mary and another UVa teammate of mine seized this opportunity to establish a break away. The chasing was brutal and lasted for ~5 miles, yet eventually fell short. The break way split from the main group around mile 20. It was this moment that I almost crashed myself-I hit the rear wheel of the rider in front of me pretty hard, and deviated from the pelotonâ€™s rolling pace line with my front wheel slipping at an daunting angle. Somewhat magically I managed not to hit the ground, re-clipped in and caught up w/ the main group. Then, too afraid of doing anything that might result in another crash, I oped to stay in the peloton.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the break away slipped away, pelotonâ€™s pace resumed its steady state. A group of 5 Navy guys stayed in the front, doing a pace line for every body at a moderate speed (~22 mph), but no real attempt to bridge the gap / catch the break away was ever made. At around mile 30, we received 3 riders dropped by the break away (and they told us the front of the race was â€œnot even closeâ€!). They immediately joined in the main group and stayed with us. This state continued until the last several miles, as the main group further split into several lead groups and a tail. I barely stayed within the first leading group and basically had no juice left for the final uphill field sprint-finished 14th. Not too bad for my first C race!

                Jefferson Cup, the annual Charlottesville USAC road race, is always a bit of a bitter experience to me. Last year, I raced in Cat 5 but did not even finish the first loop-damn crammmmmp. Had to quit the race not even halfway trough and gained my first-ever DNF.

                In the early spring I raced a couple collegiate races including North Carolinaâ€™s Chapel Hill RR. By the time Jefferson Cup came around the corner in late April, I felt fresher than ever. So much more that I decided on racing Cat 4-an almost equivalent category of Collegiate C but failed to induce some of my fellow teammate to race in the same category - meaning that I would be the only UVa rider in the 60-ish pack. Oops.

                 I was fortunate enough to convince one of my grad friends that the race is *so worth going to* that he would give me a ride to the venue since my race starts at 9:00am. Although the race start located only a couple miles away from my dorm house and was actually on one of Charlottesvilleâ€™s road cycling training route, I opted not to ride there myself since 1) the Cat C race lasts 50 miles; 2) I ate bacon egg sandwich from Cavalier Diner on breakfast.

                The race started with a 2-mile neutral roll out. Since Jeff Cup had a course thatâ€™s hell to dropped riders (frequent steep climbs), no one tried separating themselves from the peleton in the first 20 miles-2 laps, and some really strong team like District Taco and VeloWorks consciously kept a few of their own in the front to pace the entire group.

              <p>
                By the end of the second lap, things started to get trickier. A few teams tried to accelerate the pace on the long false flat just ahead of the start line (on which most would naturally tend to recover). It was not until the end of the third lap, or even the beginning of the fourth lap (?) that a few riders got away and established a sizable gap (around a minute, I think?). For about 6 or 7 miles the *still visible* break way stayed, but eventually most of it dropped back into the peloton, as if not everybody in it wanted to keep the gap. I kept riding hard so that I got to stay in the peleton, as exhausted riders were being dropped from the back (this was already the 5th lap, probably).
              </p>
              <p>
                The last lap did not see any drama at all. However, I CRAMPED AGAIN in the last turn into Carters Mountain rd. Bearing the mindset of a spectacular bunch sprint finish, only had to pull over in the last couple hundred meters because of cramping. A race volunteer in one of the following wheel trucks approached me as he thought I had a mechanical, but I told him that I had a big cramp in my legs and kindly declined the offer of using the wheel truck. Slowly rolling to the finished line as fast as I can, I finished 36th out of 60-ish riders of my field. I hate the cramping that happened again, but *merely* finishing the race was already one step forward for me.
              </p>
              <p>
                My friend showed up minutes after I headed back to Walton Middle (where the roll out began). I rendezvoused with a couple fellow UVa racers gave out my unused energy gel. Given my current status I was pretty certain that this would be my last race of the season. Time for finals and bigger challenges!

  "A brief look on how to use Stanford CoreNLP server to perform simple NLP operations with Python's NLTK package",
  "  <p>Stanford core NLP, developed and largely maintained by the Stanford Natural Language Processing Group, offers a powerful toolkit of natural language processing including tokenization, named entity recognition and part-of-speed tagging. Since it is a Java-based application, wrappers are required for it to be used in other languages. This article focuses on the use of Stanford Core NLP in Python through Pythonâ€˜s Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK 3.3) for English and Simplified Chinese.</p>
              <h3>
                Tokenization
              </h3>
              <p>
                <b>Tokenization</b> refers to the process of dividing a given text into smaller pieces (i.e. tokens) that can be used for further processing (NER / POS tagging). Since English, and many Indo-European languages are naturally tokenized (words separated by spaces), tokenization of English can be done with a single line of code, taking a paragraph of Wikipediaâ€˜s article on <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Leyte_Gulf>Battle of Leyte Gulf</a> as an example:
              </p>
              <script src=https://gist.github.com/Haotian9850/a24cf50d8b913652115544757dfe4302.js></script>
              <p>
                For some non-English languages such as Chinese, tokenization is a bit trickier, since in those languages, words (or â€œmeaningful pieces of charactersâ€) are not separated by any delimiter in a sentence. Therefore, to tokenize Chinese, tools like <code>StanfordSegmenter</code> will come in handy. Here is an example, using a paragraph from the same article but in Simplified Chinese:
              </p>
              <script src=https://gist.github.com/Haotian9850/928fb00d9ff49b6e2c86c3cff0be46ee.js></script>
              <p>
                which yields the tokenized text (still a string with tokens separated by spaces):
              </p>
              <script src=https://gist.github.com/Haotian9850/2731d31809977c56fa3b050dab4cf225.js></script>
              <h3>
                NER
              </h3>
              <p>
                To use Stanford CoreNLP for Named-Entity Recognition (NER), some language model jars need to be downloaded before hand and variable CLASSPATH configured. Here is an example of using <code>StanfordNERTagger</code> to tag a paragraph from the English Wikipedia article on  <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Leyte_Gulf>Battle of Leyte Gulf</a>:
              </p>
              <script src=https://gist.github.com/Haotian9850/6db7fb7dc93b07b81d13deca7d567525.js></script>
              <p>And it gives the following result:</p>
              <script src=https://gist.github.com/Haotian9850/2d07bba732129029c029a5dc34676cde.js></script>
              <p>
                Once the text is tokenized, NER works pretty much the same for every language including Chinese. To use <code>StanfordNERTagger</code> to NER tag a paragraph of already tokenized text in Simplified Chinese, run the following code:
              </p>
                <script src=https://gist.github.com/Haotian9850/0e0bf005987550dc30372fac66d458c5.js></script>
                <p>
                  Chinese tagging result will be in a slightly different format,

  "Impact of Foreign Events on America's Racial Dynamics: World War II and the 1980s Trade War ",
  "Hao",
  "A brief look of how important international events such as WWII and trade war in the late 20th century shaped America's racial dynamics. Originally submitted as class project of AMST 3180: Intro. to Asian American Study offered in 2017 Spring at the University of Virginia. ",
  "<p>
No American minority history was shaped more by foreign events than that of Asian Americans. When major world events occurred, certain national sentiments were raised and directed towards specific Asian American ethnic groups. These national sentiments also triggered the implementation of governmental practices and state-sponsored discrimination that modified Asian Americansâ€™ socioeconomic status, and sometimes even stripped away their civil rights. This essay will focus on two prominent historical events, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 and the international trade war in the 1980s and address the fundamental changes they brought to Asian Americans including the Japanese, the Chinese and many other ethnic groups.  
</p>
<p>
Japanâ€™s sneak attack on Pearl Harbor on December 11, 1941 directly resulted in Americaâ€™s entering of World War II and the consequent internment of Japanese Americans. But it did not affect the Japanese only: through the marginalization and temporary absence of Japanese Americans in continental America, many racial groups who saw the Japanese as competitors-the Chinese, the Korean and the Filipino Americans were accepted into Americaâ€™s labor-demanding war industry and their social status quickly elevated. The Chinses were able to break out the laundry and restaurant industries in which they had been long constrained; â€œthey (the Chinese) have gone in the army and navy, into shipbuilding and aircraft plantsâ€¦even the girls are getting jobs (Lee 290).â€ The Japanese attack on American soil also fostered a new way for Asian Americans to â€œperfect their citizenshipâ€ by joining American army under a justified course: to fight against Japanese in the Asian countries invaded by Imperial Japan. On an international level, Americaâ€™s declaration of war against Japan led to its alliance with Japanâ€™s rivals in Asia such as China; as a result, nearly all the exclusion act prior to 1941 was voted down and naturalization citizenships for Asians became possible. This also led some Asian Americans to see their new-gained citizenship not only as a granted gift from America but also a sacred responsibility to a country they served for, resulting in a shift in their self-imaging and political identity. As recounted by Buaken, a solider of the Filipino regiment, â€œWe are taking on a broad responsibility, a triple responsibility, really (Buaken 292).â€ Ultimately, these activities changed (white) Americansâ€™ perception on Asians as â€œNo longer do Americans think of the Chinese as mysterious Orientals from a little-known land (Lee 290)â€. They also greatly facilitated Asian American (except for Japanese Americans, who later became the first â€œModel Minorityâ€) assimilation, bringing greater interracial integration and harmony.  
</p>
<p>
Nearly 40 years later, the domestic economic recession and dumping of Asian goods into American market affected its racial picture again by causing the anti-Asian national sentiment while the unemployment rate in the United States rocketed. In traditionally manufacture-bred cities such as Detroit, the hatred of foreign goods-cars, house appliances and heavy machinery that were mainly exported from Japan at a much lower price point was particularly prominent. Several White-Asian conflicts including the death of Vincent Chin and Jim Loo, where the Asian was typically recognized as unwelcomed Japanese or â€œengineerâ€ Asians who carried off local jobs occurred in this context. The controversial court adjudications that largely favored the White side following these incidents became a source of outrage from Asian American communities during the mid-1980s, raising awareness of the anti-Asian racism among Asian communities. The notion of â€œyellow power (Uyematsu)â€ was coined when the sense of being another victim alongside the established Black-White problem was added to the Asian American political identity. The change in Asian Americansâ€™ political identity also fostered interracial coalitions (typically Asian-black) that demanded more civil rights on the legislation level as both of them were addressed by Uyematsu as â€œpart of the Third World struggle to liberate all colored people (Uyematsu 9).â€  
</p>
<p>
Two documentary films, History and Memory: For Akiko and Takashige and Who Killed Vincent Chin depict the impact of the World War II and the trade war in 1980s on domestic racial dynamics respectively. To discuss the impact of these events more specifically, one scene is selected from each film as follow. 
</p>
<p>
In History and Memory: For Akiko and Takashige, the scene from 6:39 to 7:15 is particularly worth exploring. In this scene, Tajiri adopted a montage portraying the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor made by Universal News in 1943 featuring randomly running people as if they had just experienced a Japanese airstrike, a group of personnel carrying a stretcher, and the close-up of a car with shattered windows and airborne machinegun bullet holes with the narrative by an American male voice vividly recounting his personal experience on the morning of Pearl Harbor attack. The scene is then followed by a total black-screen, with Tajiriâ€™s monologue: 
</p>
<p>
â€œThere are things which have happened for which the only images that exist are in the minds of the observers, present at the time, while there are things which have happened for which there have been no observers, except for the spirits of the dead.â€ 
</p>
<p>
The juxtaposition of the disordered footages from Universal News and seemingly empty black-screnness serves to deliver Tajiriâ€™s message that while media depicting the Pearl Harbor Attack flourished, there was a lack of honest audiovisual record of mainland Japanese Americans being interned. The rendering of running people, carrying-around of stretchers and destroyed automobiles all lead to recreation of a generic post-attack scene, as nearly all of them were shot from an eye-level angle to bring more audience immersion which was then furthered by the insertion of realistic back ground noise. There is neither any such image nor background sound in the second part of the scene from 7:00 to 7:15 except for a single yet powerful monologue that guided the audiences through. The absence of image is a clear sign of the absence of image on events whose exposure to the public was not favored by the government. It is also an implication that people who underwent such a significant event (i.e. the internment) did not have capital to re-create their experience in contrast with several of the re-created scenes before itself. Instead, state-sponsored national narrative of the war against Japan â€œscreens out more disruptive image (Sturken 36)â€ such as the internment of mainland Japanese Americans. 
</p>
<p>
The lack of representation of the internment has a profound consequence. The over-abundance of battle scenes against Japan and the lack of visual representation of Japanese Americans being interned during World War II resulted in a one-face perception, or, a deliberate mixing of the meanings of â€œJapanese (who America saw as an enemy)â€ and â€œJapanese Americans (who were American citizens)â€ for the American public. With the fear of â€œthe 5th columnâ€, such mixing justified the internment of Japanese Americans by convincing the public that it was impelled by a military necessity. Yet, the internment experience for the Issei and Nisei in the post-war era transformed into their determination of gaining more social power in a country dominated by potentially unfriendly Whites, as argued by Petersen, â€œto sum up, these Nisei were squaresâ€¦their education was conducted like a military campaign against a hostile worldâ€¦they fought for certain limited positions and won them (Petersen 40).â€ Through these struggles, Japanese Americans became â€œmodel minoritiesâ€, a notion that other Asian ethnic groups quickly joined in.

The highly cartoonish scene in Who Killed Vincent Chin from 31:00 to 31:54 presents an explanation of the national anti-Asian sentiment during the America-Japan trade war in the 1980s, which was argued by the movie itself as a blasting fuse of the murder of Vincent Chin. Totally animated, this scene contains a swarm of viciously smiling foreign little cars, infiltrating continental America from both the pacific and the Atlantic direction and forcing the statue of liberty to change her orientation and panic. Bending the Golden Gate Bridge and falling into big waterfalls, these little cars finally gathered at a huge drive-in movie theater, where their massive presence startled the kissing, Hollywood-style couple on screen which was then broken up in shock.  
</p>
<p>
In spite of the difference in style, this scene is seamlessly incorporated into the larger picture of the film, building up the reason for the question asked by the filmâ€™s title. Although it somewhat deviated from the interview-dominated and realistic tone of the film, this scene utilizes the dramatic exaggeration effect of animation to highlight Americansâ€™ reaction to massive import of foreign cars. The breaking-up of the Hollywood-style kissing couple on screen while falling into the ocean of foreign cars visualized the fear that the American self-sufficientness, largely symbolized by the ability to manufacture middle-class articles such as cars domestically would be disturbed by massive foreign imports; the march-style background music also creates a feeling of invasion. Through such visualization, this scene effectively points out the behind reason of Chinâ€™s murder: he was a scapegoat of the hatred towards Asians derived from the hatred Asian goods which was blamed by white workers for the decline of America industry.
</p>
<p>
Both World War II and the change in world economy in the 1980s had dramatic effect on domestic Asian groups, while their relation to other races were also reshaped, all of which became a part of larger American history; the history of America itself is often characterized by events of interracial tension and conflicts, but often ends in greater mutual understanding and harmony that marked progress through the struggles of determined individuals who preserved memories and called for justice just as Tajiri, Choy and Tajima. Through their productions, the less known side of history was shown in a more comprehensive way, and the audiences enlightened.

  "Alternative Theories Reinforcing Existing Evidences for A Paleo-ocean on Mars",
  "Hao",
  "A look into alternative theories that provide evidences for a giant paleo-ocean on Mars. Originally submitted as term paper for ASTR 3880 - Planetary Science offered in Fall 2017 semester at the University of Virginia",
  "<p>The hypothesis that Mars once was warm and its atmosphere dense enough to sustain an active hydrosphere and a giant ocean covering up to 1/3 of its surface on the northern hemisphere possesses profound implications. This hypothesis is supported by various evidences through orbital and landing missions of Mars. These evidences include unique topographic features such as inferred remnants of ancient shorelines and a global valley network, as well as a fleeing atmosphere. Unfortunately, by far none of these evidences qualifies a definite verdict such as the discovery of marine sediments on the northern lowland that will guarantee the existence of an ancient ocean: the identified shorelines are largely deformed with a long-wavelength and long-amplitude variation in their elevation up to a few kilometers, while the origin and volume of the global valley network remains topics of fierce debate. The lack of sufficient water inventory on todayâ€™s Mars to support the volume of the proposed ancient ocean is also used as a counterargument against the ancient ocean hypothesis (Luo et al. 7). Nevertheless, alternative theories are being developed to explain these imperfections in existing evidences and render the them more credible. This essay will focus on the Ture Polar Wander and Tsunami theory which were proposed from the results returned by the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) and Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) missions to explain the deformation and variation in elevation of the Martian shorelines, discuss relevant studies of the volume of water flow that created the global valley network and address the lack of water inventory by looking into the fleeing atmosphere of Mars and the â€œSputteringâ€ effect, largely based on the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution mission (MAVEN).</p>
<p>The observations of a set of rings and mountains around the Northern lowlands of Mars that resembles paleoshoreline suggests an ancient ocean had covered this region. The network of such rings and mountains coincides the elevation division between Southern and Northern hemisphere (Perron et al. 840). The candidates for the paleoshoreline include large areas such as the Arabia Terra and Deuteronilus Mensae, two adjacent units with relatively smooth elevation change. Nevertheless, this hypothesized paleoshoreline features are not ideally credible as evidence for an ancient ocean: the shorelines are largely deformed with irregular contour profile, and along the putative shorelines there exists a long-wavelength and long-amplitude elevation variation up to several kilometers, which does not follow the Martian geoid, the surface of equal gravitational potential (Rodriguez et al. 1). The lack of wave-cut paleoshoreline features and the presence of lobate margins appeared to be inconsistent with the paleo-ocean hypothesis (1). These additional observations are utilized as counterarguments against the hypothesis that Mars once had a global ocean. </p>

<p>The lack of definitive shoreline on Mars could be firstly addressed by the hypothesis that multiple (mostly likely two) gigantic tsunami events caused by crater impacts on the ocean floor in the Hesperian Eon has resurfaced Mars and subsequently changed the appearance of its shorelines. Two lines of observations from regions including Tempe Terrae and part of the Arabia Terra provide support for the occurrence of two gigantic tsunami events on Mars: first, multiple regions on the Arabia and Tempe Terrae appeared thermally bright (rocky exposures) on the Mars Thermal Emission Image System (THEMIS) night-time infrared images and are distinguished from the sharp transition of the surface surround them which appeared thermally dark (fine-grained surface) (Rodriguez et al. 3). Through refined analysis, the composition of these bright regions is suggested as boulder deposits which might have been brought ashore by tsunami wave. In addition, the orientation and composition of these boulder deposits negates any possibility of uphill unidirectional wind (which might generate similar elongated aeolian deposit, i.e. wind streak of similar appearance) emplacing them (2). Therefore, the discovery of these boulder deposits qualifies the first evidence of high-speed and sediment-rich tsunami waves from a paleo ocean. Secondly, a series of flowing channels on Northwestern of Deuteronilus Mensae displays features highly similar to those of high-energy Tsunami front on earth: well-defined landward lobate margins around broad promontories, as tsunami front on Earth tend to show diversion around surface obstacles (4). In addition, the crater counting throughout the Northern plain of Mars also support a reasonable number of bolide impacts that were intense enough to cause a tsunami whose wave front would result in the large deformation of shorelines (6).</p>

<p>Another alternative theory explains the blurring of Martian shorelines by suggesting that it was caused by Ture Polar Wander (TPW), the shift of Martian orientation relative to its rotational axis. TPW is believed to happen on many solar system objects including Earth, Europa and Mars, since the mass distributions of them are not perfectly spherical symmetric. As a result of TPW, the geographical locations of both south and north pole shift and thus bring changes to planetary surface features. On Mars, the high mass concentration on Tharsis Volcano complex results in an uneven mass distribution which is the primary factor that caused TPW. Given the widely accepted antiquity of the proposed Martian ocean, TPW might have sufficient time to deform the paleoshoreline to the extent as they are seen today. The polar translocation caused by TPW would lead to a geographically variable change in a planetâ€™s solid surface and geoid (especially when it has a weak, elastic lithosphere), resulting in a non-uniform sea level through time, therefore generating shoreline topography (Perron et al. 841).  The trace of paleopoles also adds credibility to the TPW theory: a convoluted TPW path is suggested by the location and timeframe of the occurrence of large basins on Mars (Jafar 496). Through this process, a net TPW angle between 30 and 60 degree since the formation of Arabia shorelines and to and 25 degree since the formation of Deuteronilus shorelines, following a path that was nearly perpendicular to the Martian equator was proposed (Perron et al. 841)|.</p>
<p>Recent studies on another intriguing surface feature on Mars-the flowing channels assumed to be carved out by flowing water may reinforce the credibility of the ocean hypothesis by proofing the volume of water flow was higher than previously concluded. Earlier investigations utilized raw data from missions including MOLA and MOC and focused on specific flowing channels such as the Kasei Valles where the channel features are particularly prominent. Since these missions brought clearer surface image with an improved resolution up to 30cm vertical and 300m along-track spatial and led to the discovery of narrower and refined channels, it was suggested that these channels imposed a lower upper limit to the volume estimation of flowing activities (Williams et al. 2). Nevertheless, more recent studies rendered a more comprehensive picture by taking the entire Martian surface into account while applying statistical methods to evaluate the volume of water flow. These methods include the Black Top Hat Transformation (BTHT), a mathematical morphology transformation used in image processing to extract dark features on an image with varied background (Luo et al. 9). The application of BTHT helped draw a new estimation of the valley depth on a pixel level from Marsâ€™ global digital map (also produced by MOLA). The volume of global valley networks (VNs) calculated through the collection of depth data suggested that the amount of water required to incise the total VNs were much higher than previously proposed with a conservative estimate of minimum of 6.86Ã—10Â¬17 m3Â¬Â¬Â¬ (1).</p>
<p>The water reservoir on todayâ€™s Mars is largely constrained in a sub-surface and inactive hydrosphere consisting of a cryosphere of permafrost and (possibly) saline underground water (Clifford and Parker 43). The water inventory of todayâ€™s Mars also contains the water-ice stored in its polar cap. The amount of water on todayâ€™s Mars is far less than that required to fill up an ocean covering up to 1/3 of its surface. Nevertheless, the high Deuterium/Hydrogen ratio (6 times higher than Earthâ€™s ocean water) detected from Martian atmosphere and on Martian asteroids (Kurokawa et al. 179) suggests that Mars had possessed a large water body in the past and thus had gone through a considerable water loss. The evidence of the presence of large water body on Martian surface suggests a far denser and moister primordial atmosphere and thus implies that a high percentage (up to 90%) of it was lost. Although the timeline of the atmospheric loss is still subjected to discussion, it is generally accepted that the primordial Martian surface consisting most of the water vapor, COÂ¬Â¬2 and other gases released during the initial accretion of Mars (Faure and Mensing 215) was capable of sustaining a surface ocean existed in the first 2 billion years since the formation of Mars, which then began to deteriorate around late Noachian/early Hesperian. During the loss of Marsâ€™ primordial atmosphere, its composition was also significantly altered by geological events such as volcanic activities (which released a significant amount of COÂ¬2), eventually resulting in todayâ€™s Martian atmosphere: 95% COÂ¬2, 1.9% Ar, 1.9%N and negligible amount of water vapor and other gases (Robbins. et al.). </p>
<p>The loss of Martian atmosphere, as revealed by the recent data from the MAVEN mission, is suggested to be tightly connected to the decaying and eventually disappearance of its magnetic field. The existence of an intense early Martian magnetic field can be traced in the ancient and heavily cratered highlands in the south (Connerney et al. 4015) and began to decay when Mars was about 500 million years old, while todayâ€™s Mars does not have a significant magnetic field, that is, 3Ã—10Â¬-4 times that of Earth (Smith et al.). The lack of magnetic field on todayâ€™s Mars is believed to be caused by lack of internal dynamo, namely, the relative motion between a liquid core and a solid inner core due to planetary rotation and convection that generate electric energy and thus a magnetic field around the planet itself. The cease of Marsâ€™ internal convection still remains a mystery, but some argue that it was the giant bombardments Mars experienced in Noachian Eon that shut down the convection by warming up its crust and disrupt its core convection. Evidences that support this assumption including the fact that only the oldest craters on Mars are magnetized.</p>
<p>The process named â€œsputteringâ€ describes how Mars might had lost its atmosphere since the vanish of its magnetic field. Without the shielding and deflection effect of a strong magnetic field, the Martian atmosphere is constantly hit by ions carried towards it by solar wind. The ions carried by solar wind, while slamming into the upper Martian atmosphere, constantly knock/sputter its atmospheric atom out of their original place, sometimes into the space. Through this process, Mars has lost a significant ratio of its paleo atmosphere. The minimum amount of the atmosphere loss percentage is backed up by the measurement of noble gas such as Argon in Martian Atmosphere. Thanks to its inertness and variance in two isotopes, Argon-38 and Argon-36 (lighter and thus can be â€œremovedâ€ from Martian atmosphere more quickly), a measurement of the ratio both isotopes can yield a sound amount of gas lost from Martian atmosphere with a lower limit of 65% (NASA MAVEN page).</p>
<p>Although an array of theories is developed to support the paleo ocean hypothesis of Mars, the timeframe of such an ocean still remains in debate. While the analysis of Martian atmosphere reveals that the water loss on Mars is more significant during the pre-Noachian era (~4.50 to 4.10 Ga) than the rest of Martian history (Kurokawa et al. 184), suggesting an ocean formed prior to the Noachian Eon (i.e. right after the formation of Mars), others, such as Clifford and Parker, state that the active Martian hydrosphere were not cold-trapped into local cryosphere until Mid-Hesperian era (~3.71 to 3.37 Ga) (which postponed the vanishing of the proposed ancient ocean significantly). Other factors that affect the timing constraints of the paleo ocean include the traces of episodic re-flooding of Northern lowlands even after the global ocean retreated into local cryosphere while the flowing channel activities gradually declined in Late Hesperian and Amazonian Eon. </p>
<p>While existing evidences of paleo-ocean hypothesis of Mars is being challenged, new theories are developed through more advanced observation and orbit/landing mission. The hypothesis of Mars, if verified, will significantly boost mankindâ€™s understanding of planetary science and possibly extraterrestrial life. Undoubtedly, it will be the single most important discovery throughout human history.</p>

                With the first race of road season 2018 just around the corner, things are getting exited. ACCC (Atlantic Collegiate Cycling Conference)â€™s first race is scheduled on Feb 24th at the College of William and Mary, which is then followed by University of Virginiaâ€™s Cavalier Criterium on the 25th north of Richmond. Yup, the â€œCavalierâ€ Criterium wonâ€™t really happen on the Grounds ðŸ˜¦ yet given UVaâ€™s large student population from Richmond (for example, my first-year roommate and *almost* his entire family!), it is still reasonable to call it a home race.

                After the trusty 105 groupo that came w/ the bike finally gave up on serving me, I was able to get my hands on Shimanoâ€™s Ultegra Di2 (6870) group set and admire how revolutionary electronic shifting really is. Itâ€™s not the latest tech, though, since Shimano has updated its road Di2 line a while ago-yet unlike mechanical parts, the difference is really minimal if you donâ€™t want some algorithm shifts your front mech for you.

                Donâ€™t be fooled by those training wheels from Vuelta. They are rugged, but also super heavy-comes with an staggering 2, 100 grams of weight (thatâ€™s roughly 4.6 pounds-sorry my American readers), a race replacement is quite necessary.

  "Lenovo ThinkPad Mobile Workstations: Design and Construction",
  "Hao",
  "An in-depth look into the design and construction of Lenovo's ThinkPad P-series mobile workstations including the P51s, P51 and P1",
  "<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>As an avid ThinkPad user, I have gone through quite a few ThinkPad over the past few years: a New S2 (special code name for Chinese market, same as the ThinkPad 13), Some Ts and eventually 3 P-series machine: the ThinkPad P51s, P51 and eventually, the long-awaited P1. This article will provide a detailed comparison and analysis on these three P-series mobile workstation machine that I had the chance to use as my daily driver for an extended period of time.</p>
<h3>Material</h3>
<p>A glance over Lenovoâ€™s ThinkPad material matrix will reveal a simple rule: higher tier machines uses more metal. Higher tier series (X1, some X, some T, and Some P) are typically composed of a CFRP display cover (A-cover) and a Al-Mg alloy case (B, C, D cover), where as other lines of product (some X, some T, some P, E, and some budget-oriented side-series, such as the 11e) tend to use GFRP or PPS throughout the body. From my personal experience, Lenovoâ€˜s choice of non-metallic materials tend to be softer and therefore more susceptible to forced deformation under load in comparison to their metal / carbon fiber counterparts. Another point of difference between these two families of materials is that display cover made out of non-metal / CF materials tend to have a special coding (â€œPeach Skinâ€) where as metal / CF surfaces on ThinkPads are way glossier.</p>

<h3>Internal Construction</h3>
<p>One of the most liked features that gained older-gen ThinkPads the reputation of being super-rugged was their adoption of internal roll cage (starting from T60 in 2006?). The roll cages of earlier ThinkPads are primarily made out of lightweight magnesium, and are there to reduced main board flex when the laptop is under torque. Flex (deformation of the main board) is the main cause of weakened solder joints and subsequent system failure. However, there are certain tradeoffs to this design: thicker, heavier and therefore less portable machines - its not hard to see why even ThinkPad (after being acquired by Lenovo) gave it up on most of its product lines while the entire mobile computing device market was shifting away from purely functional designs to prioritizing lightweight and thinness (a trend that can be mostly attributed to Apple in the early 2010s). Itâ€™s worth mention that roll cages are <i>not</i> entirely on ThinkPads, through - some modern Ps still have it, such as the P51 / 52 and the P71 / 72.</p>
<img class=image src=../resources/img/thinkpad-p51-roll-cage.jpg>
<p class=caption>A look of the ThinkPad P51â€™s internal roll cage with its palm rest (C-cover) and keyboard removed. P51â€™s inner roll cage is made out of lightweight magnesium and covers the machineâ€™s main board, heat sink and fan, and extends to the battery. Note there are two additional RAM slots under the keyboard, giving the Thinkpad P51 a total of 4 DIMM slots.</p>
<p>The P51s and P1, however, have a less robust internal roll cage system then the P51.</p>

<h3>Input / Output</h3>
<h4>Keyboard</h4>
All the Ps maintained ThinkPadâ€™s great, smiley shape keyboards. Due to its large footprint, both key travel and the required weight to press a key is marginally greater on the P51 (or was it just different keyboard vendor?). Nevertheless, the three machines all use the same key board structure and generally, typing experience remained consistent across all three machines.  
<h4>Display</h4>
The three Ps that I had the chance to use are all of FHD (1080 x 1980) panels. According to Lenovo, both the P51s and P51 use a 72% + 250 nit color gamut screen (sRGB), whereas the panel of P1 has a higher color gamut (around 88%) and is also much brighter (300 nit). Neither are perfect, whereas the P1 has a much better FHD display than the P51. Besides, all three offer 4K with 100% color gamut options, while the P1 tops out with a vibrant HDR 4K display that promises to cover up to 100% of Adobe RGB (!!). 
<h3>Connectivity</h3>
All three machines have excellent ports. All are equipped with HDMI and USB 3.0 Type-A (3 on the P51s and P51, 2 on P1), USB Type-C Thunderbolt (P51s: 1x, 2x PCIe, P51: 1x, 4x PCIe, P1: 2x both 4x PCIe). Due to their larger footprint, both the P51 and P51s have a standard RJ45 Ethernet connection, whereas the P1 employs a Lenovo-priperitory mini-RJ45 port which requires a dongle to function. Lenovo chose to preserve RJ45 on its mobile workstation ThinkPads so that users donâ€™t have to change their MAC address while using wired connections. Besides, the P51 also comes with a USB Type-B (mini DP) port and also an express card slot. I found these port generally redundant in my daily workflow, but they may be useful for particular users (e.g. electrical engineers, embedded system engineers, etc.).

<h3>Internal Design</h3>

<p>Although all three machines are marketed as ThinkPadâ€™s premier mobile workstations, their internal designs are rather different, each specializing in fulfilling needs of a particular flavor of mobile workstation users: in general, both the P51s and P1 are more â€œultrabookâ€-like, whereas the P51 more closely resembles traditional â€œpowerhouseâ€ mobile workstation type. Take a look at their main boards:</p>

<p class=caption>P51sâ€™ main board. Note the placement of the heat sink, DIMM slots and drive (single mSATA connection). To adapt both M.2 NGFF and 7.5 mm drive form factor, Lenovo (possibly Yamato Lab?) designed a special 2.5 inch drive case for M.2 drives. Unfortunately, this design limits the drive bandwidth to only 2x PCIe (instead of 4x PCIe) and eliminated the chance of any regular 2280 M.2 connector that supports 4x bandwidth-possibly a questionable design choice? By 2018, even the Es have dual drive system that support both SATA and M.2 connections. Another notable feature of the P51s is its bridge battery system notably visible in the above picture: with an internal </p>

<p class=caption>P51â€™s main board. Rather then relying on a single fan, P51 uses a single-pipe dual-fan cooling configuration that takes advantage of its thicker body. Also note that only 2 out of 4 DIMM slots are shown in this picture; the P51 comes with 4 DIMM slots. Image courtesy of thinkscopes.com</p>
<img class=image src=../resources/img/P1-main-board.jpg>
<p class=caption>P1â€™s main board. To provide sufficient cooling for its standard-voltage processor and graphic card, P1 is also equipped with a dual-fan, dual-pipe heat sink. A notable additional feature many â€œthin and lightâ€ mobile workstation lacks is P1â€™s  ability to take 2 M.2 drives, giving it a maximum PCIe storage capacity of 4TB.</p>

<h3>Customizability</h3>
<p>Customizability on all three P-series machines is consistent across the board: both drive and RAM can be easily accessed and replaced on all three machines without hassle. Thanks to its larger chassis, the P51 is able to take up to three drives 2x M.2 SSD and 1x 2.5 inch drive (such as a 7.5 mm SATA III SSD), something only to be envied by most ultrabooks on the market.</p>

<h3>If I want a mobile workstation, which one should I get?</h3>
<p>IMHO if you need a mobile workstation as you <b>daily driver</b>, you are:</p>
<ul>
<li>CAD professional, or</li>
<li>Professional content creater (video / audio), or</li>
<li>Software engineer who likes to run everything <b>locally</b></li>
</ul>
<p>As a former front-end web developer wannabe, my primary choice of computer was the P51s - extra-long battery life, OK performance (dual-core 7th i7) for common web development stack like <b>Node, LAMP and MEAN</b> with really good pricing. But soom I foolishly broke the only mSATA connector on the P51sâ€™ motherboard and was compelled to buy a new machine. The P51 seemed an overkill for me given my computational needs but I still bought it for its reasonable market price (1+ year post-release) and generally good user reviews. In my studies afterwards, it turned out to be incredibly stable, powerful and reliable in doing works with more demanding tech stacks such as <b>Hadoop / Horton Sandbox</b>, <b>Android Studio</b> and big full-stack <b>Spring</b> projects...Then I wanted something newer and even more powerful: here comes the P1. By now I have no complaints whatsoever; the P1 seems to even more powerful than the P51 despite its supposedly worse thermal due to its slimmer design (obviously, the processor is one generation ahead).</p>
<p>All three aforementioned machines are branded as mobile workstations by Lenovo, yet they are destined to serve different user groups. Get the P51s (or P52s or any T5X0 variants) if you:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Really</b> want ridiculously long battery life: with the bridge battery system (max total capacity: 106.5 WHr), 20+ continuous working hour is no joke (given 6 - 9 w average power consumption reported by <i>powertop</i> under relatively light workload)</li>
<li><b>Values</b> portability: the system weight approximately 2.0 kg (4.4 pounds) - good for a 15.6â€™ machine but not top of the line</li>
<li><b>Have no needs for multimedia content creation: </b>the Quadro card in P5Xs series is weak compared to the regular Ps (M520 in P51s and P500 in P52s), and screen brightness (~250 nit) and color gamut on their 1080p screen isnâ€™t impressive (45%). That said, they are still suitable for programmers and general multimedia consumption</li>
</ul>
<p>Get the P51 (or P52) if you:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Do not </b>need high mobility: the system weights at least 2.45 kg (5.4 pounds), and its materials are questionably improvable (particularly display cover - why not CFRP Lenovo???). And the stock 170W AC adapter adds another ~400g, although lighter alternatives do exist</li>
<li><b>Have</b> needs for multimedia content creation: Quadro cards in P51 / P52 come with a big range of options up to M2200M in P51 and P3200 in P52. With those cards and the Pâ€™s outstanding thermal design, editing / creating videos (and even VR contents on P52) should not be too much of a problem. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Extra note: Linux compatibility...</h3>
<p>If you are a developer of any kind that does not use a Mac, the chances are you will eventually install some flavor of Linux on your Windows machine. ThinkPads are known for good Linux compatibility; all the ThinkPads I worked on in the past were fully compatible with every Ubuntu LTS. However, things are a little tricky on Lenovoâ€˜s latest Ps: both the P51s and P51 were Ubuntu friendly (Ubuntu was the distro I used most often): both Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04 LTS runned on these machines without any problem or hurdle-no Nvidia driver nightmare, on missing drivers, even the ThinkPad hotkeys worked out of the box. However, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS cannot be installed on the P1 without tweaking some of the pre-configured acpi and Nvidia driver settings. In pursuit of a high availability system, I opted for System76â€™s open-source POP!_OS (which embedded theirs proprietary Nvidia driver) and installation was a success. Actually, it turned out to me that POP!_OS was in fact in many ways superior than just Ubuntu (the latest POP!_OS LTS is based on Ubuntu 17.10 LTS, but with a slightly tweak gnome session and some UI mods) in terms of multi-language input config, switching between dedicated and integrated graphics (yes, you can do that!) and general UI. </p>
